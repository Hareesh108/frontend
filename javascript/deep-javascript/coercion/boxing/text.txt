𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐧 — 𝐁𝐨𝐱𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝

• JavaScript lets you access properties on primitive values
  - Example: string length, number methods, boolean methods

• Primitives are not objects
  - string, number, boolean are primitive types

• So how does "hello".length work?  - 

• This behavior is called boxing
  - JavaScript temporarily wraps a primitive in its object counterpart

• Boxing is an implicit coercion
  - Primitive → Object (only for the operation)

• JavaScript does this automatically
  - You never see or manage the wrapper object

• After the operation, the object is discarded
  - The value remains a primitive

• 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐲 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 “𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭”
  - Things can behave like objects
  - That doesn’t mean they are objects

• Boxing exists for developer ergonomics
  - Without it, accessing properties on primitives would throw errors

• Boxing happens with:
– strings
– numbers
– booleans

• Boxing does NOT change the original value
  - It only enables property and method access

• This is one of JavaScript’s quiet superpowers
  - Powerful, convenient, and easy to miss
