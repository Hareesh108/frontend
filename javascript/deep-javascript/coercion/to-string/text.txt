• ToString is an abstract operation
It describes how JavaScript converts any value into a string
It exists in the spec, not as a callable function

• Almost every value has a string representation
null, undefined, booleans, numbers — all become strings

• Negative zero is a corner case
ToString hides the sign and produces "0"

• When ToString is applied to non-primitives
JavaScript first runs ToPrimitive with a string hint

• Arrays have a built-in ToString behavior
Brackets are removed
Elements are joined with commas

• Empty arrays become an empty string
This makes it impossible to distinguish from other empty outputs

• null and undefined inside arrays are skipped
Their positions exist, but their values disappear
This is one of the strangest inconsistencies in JavaScript

• Array stringification is unreliable for program logic
It may look useful in the console
But it has too many corner cases for real code

• Objects default to a generic string
The famous “[object Object]”

• That output comes from the object’s string tag
The default tag is “Object”

• The string tag can be customized
ES6 allows overriding it using a symbol

• You can also override toString itself
This gives full control over how an object is represented as a string

• Custom ToString logic is useful for debugging
Especially in dev tools
But rarely recommended for application logic
