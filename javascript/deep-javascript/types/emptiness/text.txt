𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐯𝐬. 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐯𝐬. 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 (𝐚𝐤𝐚 𝐓𝐃𝐙) 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭 — 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰

• 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝
  - Variable exists, but currently has no value
  - Common with declared variables that were never assigned

• 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝
  - Variable does not exist in any accessible scope
  - Accessing it throws an error
  - typeof is the only exception (returns "undefined")

• Why this is confusing
  - JavaScript treats undeclared variables as "undefined" when using typeof
  - This is a historical design quirk

• 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 (𝐚𝐤𝐚 𝐓𝐃𝐙)
  - Introduced with let and const (ES6)
  - Variable exists, but cannot be accessed yet

• TDZ is NOT undefined
  - Accessing a TDZ variable immediately throws an error
  - It is completely off-limits until initialized

• Three kinds of “𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬” in JavaScript
– undeclared → never created
– undefined → created, but no value
– uninitialized (TDZ) → created, but inaccessible
