# WebSocket Keep-Alive: Ping/Pong Explained

WebSockets, unlike plain TCP, have their **own keep-alive mechanism**:  
the **PING** and **PONG** control frames.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Not Just Rely on TCP Keep-Alive?

- **TCP keep-alive** only ensures the health of the underlying TCP connection.  
- But WebSocket connections can traverse **intermediaries** like:
  - Proxies  
  - Load balancers  
  - Gateways  

These intermediaries may terminate idle TCP sessions.  
So, relying solely on TCP keep-alive isn't always enough.

## ðŸ”¹ How WebSocket Keep-Alive Works

- **PING frame** â†’ Sent by one peer to check if the other peer is still responsive.  
- **PONG frame** â†’ Automatically sent back in response to a `PING`.  

âœ¨ Both `PING` and `PONG` frames can carry **optional application data**, although they are usually kept small.

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of WebSocket Ping/Pong

1. âœ… Keeps the WebSocket connection active.  
2. âœ… Detects broken or unresponsive peers.  
3. âœ… Refreshes idle intermediary TCP connections (important when crossing proxies).

## ðŸ”¹ Debugging with Wireshark

If the WebSocket traffic is over **TLS (wss://)**, you can still inspect `PING` and `PONG` frames using Wireshark by decrypting the traffic:

1. Set the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable in Chrome or Firefox.  
2. Point Wireshark to this key log file.  
3. Wireshark can then decrypt TLS and show WebSocket frames, including `PING` and `PONG`.

```txt
Client â†’ Server : PING (heartbeat)
Server â†’ Client : PONG (response)
