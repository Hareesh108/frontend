# 📌 Frontend System Design

Frontend system design is the process of **architecting and planning** the structure, components, data flow, and interactions for the *client side* of a web or mobile app. It’s about building a frontend that is **scalable, maintainable, performant, and user-friendly**.

---

## ✅ Key Aspects of Frontend System Design

### 1️⃣ Application Architecture

- Choose an overall structure: MVC, component-based, micro-frontends.
- Organize the project folder: components, assets, state, utils.
- Define module boundaries.

### 2️⃣ State Management

- Local state (inside components).
- Global state (Redux, Zustand, MobX, Context API).
- Server state (React Query, SWR).

### 3️⃣ Performance

- Code splitting, lazy loading.
- Virtualization for long lists.
- CDN for static assets.

### 4️⃣ API Design & Integration

- REST, GraphQL, WebSockets.
- Error handling & retries.
- Client-side caching.

### 5️⃣ Scalability & Maintainability

- Modular codebase for team collaboration.
- Linters, formatters, code standards.
- Reusable component libraries and design systems.

### 6️⃣ User Experience (UX)

- Loading states, skeleton screens.
- Accessibility (ARIA roles, semantic HTML).
- Responsive design for all devices.

### 7️⃣ Deployment & Delivery

- Bundling, minification.
- CI/CD pipelines.
- Rollback strategies.

## 📚 Example Frontend System Design Questions

- Design a file upload feature for millions of users.
- Build an infinite scrolling feed.
- Architect a large React app for multiple teams.
- Handle real-time updates in a collaborative editor.

---

## 🎯 Example Question: Infinite Scrolling Feed

**Question:**  
*"Design an infinite scrolling feed (like Twitter or Instagram) for millions of users."*

---

### ✅ 1. Clarify Requirements

- What content types? Text, images, videos?
- Sorting: latest posts or personalized?
- Real-time updates needed?
- Ads or promoted posts?
- Rate limits or offline mode?

---

### ✅ 2. High-Level Architecture

- **Feed Container Component:** Renders the list.
- **Post Component:** Renders individual post.
- **API Layer:** Supports pagination.
- **State Management:** Tracks loaded posts, loading status, next cursor.

---

### ✅ 3. Data Fetching & Pagination

- Use **lazy loading** with initial batch + on-scroll.
- Prefer **cursor-based pagination** over offset.
- Debounce or throttle scroll events.

---

### ✅ 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Virtualization** with `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
- Lazy load images with placeholders.
- Pre-fetch next pages as user nears end.
- Serve static assets via CDN.

---

### ✅ 5. Error Handling & UX

- Loading spinner or skeleton loaders.
- Retry on failure.
- Empty feed handling.
- “New posts” banner or pull-to-refresh.

---

### ✅ 6. Real-Time Updates (Optional)

- Use **WebSockets** or Server-Sent Events.
- Show “New posts available” banner instead of auto-inserting.

---

### ✅ 7. Test & Deploy

- Test on slow networks.
- Test on mobile devices.
- Automate with CI/CD.
- Monitor logs and analytics.

---

### ✅ Tech Choices

- React with `react-query` for fetching.
- `react-window` for virtualization.
- `Intersection Observer API` for scroll detection.
- CDN for images and media.
- REST or GraphQL with cursor-based pagination.

---

## 📝 Example Wrap-Up

> *“I’d build an infinite scroll feed with React, using virtualized lists for performance. I’d fetch paginated data using cursor-based pagination with react-query. I’d lazy load images and pre-fetch next pages. Scroll detection would use the Intersection Observer API. For real-time, I’d integrate WebSockets with a ‘new posts’ banner. Static assets would come from a CDN. Error states and loading skeletons ensure smooth UX.”*
